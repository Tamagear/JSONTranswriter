## Configuration
1. Download the newest [Release](https://github.com/Tamagear/JSONTranswriter/releases) *(.zip File)*.
2. Extract the .zip File into a directory of your choice.

## Usage
1. Open `GUI/ChromaJSONEditor.exe`

## How it works
We use a simple JSON file to store our card information in. By reading from and writing to this file, the user can alter the JSON file.
Upon generation, a template is applied and colorized according to the card information. For each card, a bing search is started where the first fitting image is set as a placeholder image for the specific card. In the end, all cards are replicated according to their quantity on the sprite atlas, which is generated (face and back) within a folder on your desktop.

- `Newtonsoft.Json`

### Image Generation / Python
- `tkinter`
